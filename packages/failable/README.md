> Pure Error Handling with TypeScript

## Why

Inspired by [Pure Error Handling](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/ch08.html#pure-error-handling), but renamed the `Left` and `Right` classes to `Err` and `Ok`, and reimplemented in `TypeScript` language. 

## Installation

```shell script
npm i @jeff-tian/failable
```

## Usage

see [test](test).
